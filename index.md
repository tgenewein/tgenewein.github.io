# [Welcome]({{ site.url }}/about/)
I am a researcher in the Deep Learning group at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group lead by [Daniel A. Braun](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/mitarbeiter/d-braun/) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. My PhD research has been focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I investigated links between bounded rationality (lately termed computational rationality) and information theory, in particular rate distortion theory. Building upon these links, I am contributing toward a theoretical framework for information-optimal hierarchical models for inference and decision-making. Additionally, I am making use of the latest breakthroughs in machine learning, particularly deep learning, to derive efficient and scalable implementations based on the theoretical insights.
