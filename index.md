## [About]({{ site.url }}/about/)
Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group lead by Daniel A. Braun at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Telematics from [Graz University of Technology](http://www.tugraz.at/). More about me is [here]({{ site.url }}/about/).

## [Research]({{ site.url}}/research/)
I am interested in building intelligent machines. One of the most important steps towards that goal is to understand how large-scale problems can be tackled with limited computational resources. In my research I investigate links between bounded rationality (lately termed computational rationality) and information theory, in particular rate distortion theory. I am working on a theoretical framework for information-optimal hierarchical models for inference and decision-making. Related topics are structure learning, lossy compression, Bayesian probability theory and computational neuroscience.
Additionally, I try to shed some light on how the human brain can do so extraordinarily well with very little computation through virtual reality experiments on structure learning and Bayesian model selection.  
More information on my research is [here]({{ site.url }}/research/). An overview of my published work and my talks is [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/).
