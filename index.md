# [About]({{ site.url }}/about/)
I am a PhD student in the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group lead by Daniel A. Braun at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. More about me is [here]({{ site.url }}/about/).

# [Research]({{ site.url}}/research/)
I am interested in building intelligent machines. Biological brains do very well at leveraging the rich structure of natural environments to extract re-usable knowledge. This knowledge speeds up learning of similar tasks and allows for performing well with limited computational resources. My research is focused on understanding how structure learning can be framed as a consequence of having limited computational capacity. I investigate links between bounded rationality (lately termed computational rationality) and information theory, in particular rate distortion theory. Building upon these links, I am working on a theoretical framework for information-optimal hierarchical models for inference and decision-making.  
Additionally, I use virtual reality experiments to shed some light on how the human brain performs structure learning and structure selection
