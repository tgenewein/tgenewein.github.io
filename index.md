# [Welcome]({{ site.url }}/about/)
I am a research scientist at DeepMind, working on AI safety. Prior to that I worked in the Deep Learning Perception group at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/en/home/home.html) on Bayesian deep learning and neural network compression. I did my PhD at the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group lead by [Daniel A. Braun](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/mitarbeiter/d-braun/) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. My PhD research has been focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I investigated links between bounded rationality (lately termed computational rationality) and information theory, in particular rate distortion theory.
