# [Welcome]({{ site.url }}/about/)
I am a PhD student at the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group lead by Daniel A. Braun at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. Our group is working on connecting sensorimotor learning with theoretical models for bounded rational decision-making. My research is focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I investigate links between bounded rationality (lately termed computational rationality) and information theory, in particular rate distortion theory. Building upon these links, I am working on a theoretical framework for information-optimal hierarchical models for inference and decision-making.
