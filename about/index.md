I am a researcher in the Deep Learning group at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) located in Renningen, near Stuttgart, Germany. We conduct machine learning research with the aim to improve the current state-of-the-art and lay the groundwork for cutting-edge solutions and services. Our horizon lies well beyond the next product generation, thus we believe it is crucial to actively and openly engage with academia and contribute towards the scientific community via publications and scientific conferences.

### Biological Cybernetics / Intelligent Systems
My PhD years were well spent at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://www.is.mpg.de/) and the [Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://kyb.mpg.de/) in Tübingen, Germany, where I was part of the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group, headed by [Daniel A. Braun](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/mitarbeiter/d-braun/). Our group was interested in connecting sensorimotor learning with theoretical models for decision-making. My research has been focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the (statistical) structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. In my PhD, I was working on theoretical models of structure learning but I also investigated structure learning and structure selection mechanisms in humans through virtual reality experiments. Detailed information about my research is [here]({{ site.url}}/research/).  

### Telematics
Before moving to Tübingen, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Telematics at Graz University of Technology](http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz/Einrichtungen/Fakultaeten/FakElektrotechnik/dek4001/studien/telematik). In my master's programme I chose to specialize on *computational intelligence* and *autonomous robots* and did my master's thesis on *structure learning for robotic motor control* under the supervision of [Wolfgang Maass](http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/), co-supervised by [Gerhard Neumann](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/GerhardNeumann) and [Elmar Rückert](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/ElmarRueckert).
During my time in Graz I was also working as a part-time software-developer at IVM Engineering and NTE Systems, mostly on embedded systems and on backends that connect to embedded systems (C/C++, C#, .NET (WCF, WPF) and also .NET Micro Framework)

### Interests
Professionally, I am interested in quantifying and dealing with uncertainty - I find it particularly interesting how well humans and animals are able to learn about and exploit the rich (stochastic) structure of their environments. Compared to artificial systems, humans are so good at dealing with structured uncertainty, for instance when adapting to novel but related tasks, transferring knowledge between domains. The prime example for dealing with structured uncertainty is perhaps sensorimotor control - a field where current state-of-the-art artificial systems still lack significantly behind.

I am a fan of the idea of lowering the barrier to make research practically reproducible. Simulation results and data analysis with complex models are often subject to many minor technical details that are omitted from a publication because they are not essential for understanding the results. In many cases these details are crucial for (re)producing the results within **reasonable time** and effort. I find that [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks provide an excellent way of sharing results. They are also a great tool for communicating ideas and teaching. Additionally, I think that lightweight virtual machines, in particular [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers are the way to go to make sure that published code is still executable years after publication (through creating independence of specific core-language and library versions) - definitely keep a look on the [open container initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/).  
I am also a big fan of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and very curious to spend more time on [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/).

Some things to get a casual conversation going:  
In my spare-time I still like to tinker a bit with embedded systems and I'm fascinated by aesthetic or intriguing implementations of theoretical phenomena (e.g. kinetic sculptures, the wave pendulum or mechanical Fourier analyzers) - of course I had to by (more than) one of [these](http://www.mandelmap.com/). I'd love to be at a Gathering for Gardner [G4G](http://gathering4gardner.org) once. I'm always curious about how to use machine learning and AI for good - I think that recently machine learning has become a tool to massively centralize wealth and power and I'd be interested in hearing about ideas on how to reverse or break that trend (education, open source/open access, ownership of the data produced by you, ...?). I'm also into baking bread and got interested in fermentation in general thanks to Sandor Katz' wonderful book *The Art of Fermentation*. If you're looking for a superb cookbook that's interesting to read even without cooking, go for Kenji Lopez-Alt's *The Food Lab*.
