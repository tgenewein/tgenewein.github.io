## PhD: Tübingen
Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://www.is.mpg.de/) and the [Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://kyb.mpg.de/) in Tübingen, Germany. I am part of the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group, headed by my supervisor Daniel A. Braun. Our group is interested in connecting sensorimotor learning with theoretical models for decision-making. My research is focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the (statistical) structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I am working on theoretical models of structure learning but I also investigate structure learning and structure selection mechanisms in humans through virtual reality experiments. Detailed information about my research is [here]({{ site.url}}/research/).  

## BSc, MSc: Graz
Before coming to Tübingen, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Telematics at Graz University of Technolgy](http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz/Einrichtungen/Fakultaeten/FakElektrotechnik/dek4001/studien/telematik). In my master's programme I chose to specialize on *computational intelligence* and *autonomous robots* and did my master's thesis on *Structure Learning for robotic motor control* at the lab of [Wolfgang Maass](http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/) under the supervision of [Gerhard Neumann](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/GerhardNeumann) and [Elmar Rückert](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/ElmarRueckert).
During my time in Graz I was also working as a part-time software-developer at [IVM Engineering](https://www.ivm.at/), mostly on embedded systems and on backends that connect to embedded systems (C/C++, C#, .NET (WCF, WPF) and also .NET Micro Framework)

## Education

  * Backend wrapper for CAN bus communication with custom hardware (.NET C#)
  * Web service communication interface on embedded platform (SOAP with .NET WCF and .NET Micro Framework)
* 2010 - 2011 (part-time): Software developer at NTE Systems, Graz
  * ZigBee-to-web communication handler for an embedded home-automation system (.NET WCF and .NET Micro Framework, plus prototype-GUI with .NET WPF) 


## Interests (aka things to chat me up)
Lately, I became a fan of the idea of lowering the barrier to make research practically reproducible. Simulation results and data analysis with complex models are often subject to many minor technical details that are omitted from a publication because they are not essential for understanding the results. In many cases these details are crucial for (re)producing the results within **reasonable time** and effort. I find that [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks provide an excellent way of sharing results. They are also a great tool for communicating ideas and teaching. I am also a big fan of [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Ocassionally, I write about about tools and projects within the Jupyter and Julia ecosystems [here]({{ site.url }}/posts/).  
In my spare-time I still like to tinker a bit with embedded systems and I'm fascinated by aesthetic or intriguing implementations of theoretical phenomena (e.g. kinetic sculptures, the wave pendulum or the mechanical Fourier analyzer). I'm also into baking bread, which I find to be quite rewarding but also meditative as it cannot be rushed. I have been keeping a sourdough starter since 2013 and got fascinated with fermentation since then. More recently, there's also a Gingerbeer plant in my fridge that I use to produce fermented tonic beverages every now and then.
