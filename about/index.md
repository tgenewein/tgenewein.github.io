Currently I'm a PhD student at the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen, Germany. I am also affiliated with the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (Tuebingen).

I am interested in the fundamental relation between decision-making and computation (i.e. information processing). Structure learning, bounded-rationality, etc.

Before coming to Tuebingen, I did my undergrad and master's degree in Telematics at Graz University of Technolgy. In my master's programme I focused on computational intelligence and robotics and did my master's thesis on *Structure Learning for robotic motor control* at the lab of Wolfgang Maass under the supervision of Gerhard Neumann and Elmar Rueckert.
During my time in Graz I was also working as a part-time software-developer, mostly on embedded systems or on backends that connect to embedded systems (C/C++, C#, .NET (WCF) and also .NET Micro Framework)
