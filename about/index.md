Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://www.is.mpg.de/) and the [Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://kyb.mpg.de/) in Tübingen, Germany. I am part of the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group, headed by my supervisor Daniel A. Braun. Our group is interested in connecting sensorimotor learning with theoretical models for decision-making. My research is focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the (statistical) structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I am working on theoretical models of structure learning but I also investigate structure learning and structure selection mechanisms in humans through virtual reality experiments. Detailed information about my research is [here]({{ site.url}}/research/).  

### Telematics
Before coming to Tübingen, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Telematics at Graz University of Technology](http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz/Einrichtungen/Fakultaeten/FakElektrotechnik/dek4001/studien/telematik). In my master's programme I chose to specialize on *computational intelligence* and *autonomous robots* and did my master's thesis on *structure learning for robotic motor control* under the supervision of [Wolfgang Maass](http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/), co-supervised by [Gerhard Neumann](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/GerhardNeumann) and [Elmar Rückert](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/ElmarRueckert).
During my time in Graz I was also working as a part-time software-developer at IVM Engineering and NTE Systems, mostly on embedded systems and on backends that connect to embedded systems (C/C++, C#, .NET (WCF, WPF) and also .NET Micro Framework)

  * Backend wrapper for CAN bus communication module (.NET C#, C++)




### Interests
Lately, I became a fan of the idea of lowering the barrier to make research practically reproducible. Simulation results and data analysis with complex models are often subject to many minor technical details that are omitted from a publication because they are not essential for understanding the results. In many cases these details are crucial for (re)producing the results within **reasonable time** and effort. I find that [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks provide an excellent way of sharing results. They are also a great tool for communicating ideas and teaching. Additionally, I think that lightweight virtual machines, in particular [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers are the way to go to make sure that published code is still executable years after publication (through creating independence of specific core-language and library versions) - definitely keep a look on the [open container initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/).  
I am also a big fan of [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Occasionally, I write about about tools and projects within the Jupyter and Julia ecosystems [here]({{ site.url }}/blog/). 

Some things to get a casual conversation going:  
In my spare-time I still like to tinker a bit with embedded systems and I'm fascinated by aesthetic or intriguing implementations of theoretical phenomena (e.g. kinetic sculptures, the wave pendulum or mechanical Fourier analyzers). I'm also into baking bread got interested in fermentation thanks to Sandor Katz' wonderful book.
