Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://www.is.mpg.de/) and the [Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://kyb.mpg.de/) in Tuebingen, Germany. I am part of the [Sensorimotor Learning and Decision-Making](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/rg/braun.html) research group, headed by my supervisor Daniel A. Braun. Our group is interested in connecting sensorimotor learning with theoretical models for decision-making. My research is focused on understanding how decision-makers can leverage the (statistical) structure of their environment in order to efficiently cope with uncertainty. I am working on theoretical models of structure learning but I also investigate structure learning and structure selection mechanisms in humans through virtual reality experiments. Detailed information about my research is [here]({{ site.url}}/research/).  

Before coming to Tuebingen, I did my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Telematics at Graz University of Technolgy](http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz/Einrichtungen/Fakultaeten/FakElektrotechnik/dek4001/studien/telematik). In my master's programme I chose to specialize on *computational intelligence* and *autonomous robots* and did my master's thesis on *Structure Learning for robotic motor control* at the lab of [Wolfgang Maass](http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/) under the supervision of [Gerhard Neumann](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/GerhardNeumann) and [Elmar Rueckert](http://www.ausy.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/ElmarRueckert).
During my time in Graz I was also working as a part-time software-developer at [IVM](https://www.ivm.at/), mostly on embedded systems and on backends that connect to embedded systems (C/C++, C#, .NET (WCF, WPF) and also .NET Micro Framework)


Lately, I became interested in lowering the barrier to make research practically reproducible. In particular, simulation results with novel algorithms or data analysis with complex models are often subject to many minor technical details that are omitted from a publication because they are not essential for understanding the results but in many cases are crucial for actually (re)producing the results. I think that sharing code is important and I find that [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks provide an excellent way of sharing results in an interactive fashion that lets others easily explore results with minimal effort. Additionally, they are a great tool for communicating ideas and teaching because they allow for very easy interaction which is often crucial for understanding. Occasionally, I write [here]({{ site.url }}/posts/) about tools and projects within the Jupyter ecosystem but also open source / open access efforts that I find worth sharing.
