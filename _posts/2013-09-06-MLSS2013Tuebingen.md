From Aug. 26th to Sep. 06th the machine learning summer school (MLSS) was held at our institute, the Max Planck institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen. The summer school features an excellent selection of speakers and is attended by more than 100 participants from all over the world. Of course, I wouldn't miss the chance to participate as a local participant.  
The last two weeks were full of great talks, but also constantly meeting other PhD students working on all kinds of interesting topics including neuroscience, biology, robotics and many more. The opportunity to socialize with so many great people and get close to some of your academic heroes was amazing - big recommendation to attend a two-week summer school at least once during your PhD.
