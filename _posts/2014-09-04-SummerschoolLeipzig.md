I participated in the 2014 summer school on autonomous learning (Sep. 1st to 4th) at the MPI for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. The topics of the summer school were

 * learning representations,
 * acting to learn (exploration)
 * learning to act in real-world environments

with participants working across the fields of neuroscience, machine learning and robotics. I also had the chance to present my work with a poster (see download). The summer school was organized very well with many great speakers (including Shun-ichi Amari!). It was also very cool to visit Leipzig and see the MPI for Mathematics in the Sciences.
