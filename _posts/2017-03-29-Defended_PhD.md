Today, I have presented and defended my PhD thesis, which concludes my graduation. I am very happy and grateful for everything I have learned through my PhD. Particularly for the people I have met along the way - many of which have inspired me and helped me broaden my horizon. The time at the MPI Tuebingen will be very hard to beat - it is an amazing place. A big thanks to Daniel Braun and Pedro Ortega for putting together our group and also my colleagues Zhen, Felix and Jordi. I will miss you guys...
