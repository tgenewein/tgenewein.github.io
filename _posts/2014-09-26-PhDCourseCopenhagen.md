I participated in the PhD course on *Information Geometry in Learning and Optimization* from Sep. 22nd to 26th, hosted at the University of Copenhagen. The course was packed with great speakers, most notably the "father" of information geometry Shun-ichi Amari. The PhD course was very well organized and attracted a great crowd of participants with quite diverse backgrounds from all over the world. Copenhagen was also an incredibly cool place to visit (never seen that many bikes in a bike-lane before), hope to be back one day...
