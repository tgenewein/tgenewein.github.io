decision-making, MEU, bounded rationality
trade-off between utility and action
emergence of natural levels of abstraction (see paper and research page)



(see [Research](/Research/) for more information on the thermodynamic framework and its connection to rate distortion theory).

The paper was presented at the NIPS 2013 workshop on [*Planning with Information Constraints*](https://old.nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Program/event.php?ID=3723) - you can find the slides [here](/Talk-NIPS-workshop-abstractions/).
