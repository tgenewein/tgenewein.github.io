I am happy to announce that I have joined the Cognitive Systems research group of Bosch. The group is part of the [corporate research](http://www.bosch.com/en/com/innovation/corporate_research/corporate-research.php) sector of Bosch and is located at the brand-new [research campus of Bosch](http://www.bosch-renningen.de/en/renningen/home_1/home.html) in Renningen (close to Stuttgart). 

The group features a great mix of people with diverse backgrounds, working on various aspects of making machines smarter. I have joined the group as a research engineer in the deep learning team and I am looking forward to getting my hands dirty with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. For a while, I have wanted to get some hands-on deep learning skills as I think that deep learning is a tool that must currently not be missing from any machine learner's tool-belt. But rather than just learning how to use deep learning as a mere tool, the goal is to rapidly advance to a stage where I can also contribute towards academic research since I believe that there is a lot of overlap with the research topics of my PhD and some very timely questions in deep learning research. One of the main reasons for me choosing to join the Cognitive Systems group is that the group not only provides a fruitful and stimulating research environment but also encourages working on the advancement of current research frontiers.
