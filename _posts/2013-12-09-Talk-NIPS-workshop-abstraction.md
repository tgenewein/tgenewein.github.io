I presented my work on *Abstraction in decision-makers with limited information processing capabilities* at the NIPS 2013 workshop on [*Planning with Information Constraints*](https://old.nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Program/event.php?ID=3723).

The main idea of the talk is that abstractions are induced because of having limited information processing capabilities. This intuition is backed up by a rate distortion framework for decision-making that is based on a thermodynamic framework for decision-making. In the talk I show that a simple extension of the thermodynamic framework leads to an optimization problem for optimal decision-making under limited computational resources that is mathematically equal to the *rate-distortion* problem  (see [Research](/Research/) for more information on the thermodynamic framework and its connection to rate distortion theory).  
The application of rate distortion to decision-making can lead to the emergence of natural levels of abstraction that are dependent on the computational capabilities of the decision-maker. I illustrated this with a toy-example in the talk - see the [slides of the talk]({{ page.downloadlink }}) or the [abstract of the talk](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ope/workshop/program.pdf).

The talk is accompanied by a paper - see [here](/Paper-NIPS-workshop-abstractions/).
