I attended this year's Tuebingen international summer school (TISS) with the title:  
"*How do we make decisions? Perspectives from philosophy and science*"

The summer school was held from Sep. 24th to 27th in the former monastery in Heiligkreuztal. The aim was to look at decision-making from different angles: neuroscience, psychology but also philosophy.  
I also had the chance to present my current work on Bayesian model selection on a poster. The corresponding publication is [here](/Paper-BayesianModelSelection/).
