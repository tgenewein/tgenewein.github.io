I visited Cambridge for a few days and had the opportunity to give a talk in Daniel Wolpert's lab at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) (CBL) at the University of Cambridge. In the talk I was presenting my recently published study on [Bayesian model selection](/Paper-BayesianModelSelection/) as well as my current work on model selection in a [sensorimotor Regression task](/Paper-OccamsRazorSensorimotor/).  
Seeing Cambridge with all its landmarks of scientific history was really amazing and sometimes felt just unreal. Cambridge is definitely worth a detour should you ever be around but have never seen it. Hope to be back one day...
