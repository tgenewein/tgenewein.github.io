I visited Cambridge for a few days and had the opportunity to give a talk in Daniel Wolpert's lab at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) (CBL) at the University of Cambridge. Seeing Cambridge with all its landmarks of scientific history but also the current research at the Wolpert lab was really amazing and sometimes felt just unreal.  
In the talk I was presenting my recently published study on [Bayesian model selection](/Paper-BayesianModelSelection/) as well as my current work on model selection in a [sensorimotor Regression task](/Paper-OccamsRazorSensorimotor/).
