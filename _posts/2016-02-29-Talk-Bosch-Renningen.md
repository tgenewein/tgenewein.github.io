I was invited to give a talk at the Cognitive Systems and Machine Learning group of Bosch Corporate Research located at the recently opened Bosch research campus in Renningen. My talk was about the theoretical aspects of my work - starting off with an introduction to information-theoretic bounded rationality and then moving on to how perception-action systems can be modeled and how bounded-optimal decision-making hierarchies can emerge as a consequence of acting optimally under limited computational resources. More information on all topics can be found on the [Research pages](/research/).

After giving my talk I spent the rest of the day talking to researchers and students of the various groups, which I really enjoyed. I was impressed by the diversity of the research projects and was positively surprised by the great atmosphere.
